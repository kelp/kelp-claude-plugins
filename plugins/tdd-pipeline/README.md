# tdd-pipeline

Claude skips tests, reviews its own work, and writes
stubs that pass. This plugin enforces test-first
discipline with four agent roles across a seven-stage
pipeline.

## How It Works

The orchestrator -- your main Claude session --
dispatches agents and reads only CLAUDE.md. It never
writes source or test files itself.

**Full pipeline** (new modules, ≥3 behaviors): seven
stages from test-writing through integration. See
[Methodology](docs/methodology.md) for the stage
diagram.

**Inline fast-track** (bug fixes, small changes):

```
1. Brief test-writer for the failing test
2. Verify RED locally, commit
3. Brief implementer for the fix
4. Verify GREEN locally, commit
```

Inline still uses two agents and two commits — RED and
GREEN are never combined — but skips the reviewer
stages and the stub/RED-gate dance, because the test
fails against the real bug, not against a stub.

The RED gate (full pipeline) catches a common failure:
stubs that contain real logic. Tests against such stubs
always pass, proving nothing. Every test must fail
before implementation begins.

Fix loops use `SendMessage` to continue the original
writer agent, not fresh dispatches — preserving the
context the agent already built up.

## Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add kelp/kelp-claude-plugins
/plugin install tdd-pipeline@kelp-claude-plugins
```

## Setup

1. Run `/tdd-init` to add a configuration template to
   your project's CLAUDE.md
2. Fill in test commands, file patterns, and lint rules

## Use

```
/tdd-orchestrate parser
```

The orchestrator reads your CLAUDE.md for project
specifics, then drives all seven stages. If a reviewer
rejects code three times, it escalates to you.

## Composition

This plugin defines the process. Your CLAUDE.md defines
project specifics, and language plugins append
corrections.

Example with Zig:
1. Install `zig-claude-kit`, run `/zig-init`
2. Install `tdd-pipeline`, run `/tdd-init`
3. Fill in test commands and file patterns
4. Run `/tdd-orchestrate` for each module

CLAUDE.md is the only integration point between plugins.

## Skills

**User-invocable:**
- `tdd-orchestrate` -- drive the 7-stage pipeline
- `tdd-init` -- add config template to CLAUDE.md

**Agent roles** (persistent role definitions, dispatched
via subagent_type):
- `test-writer` -- write tests and type stubs
- `test-reviewer` -- review tests for correctness
- `implementer` -- write implementation code
- `code-reviewer` -- review implementation

Each agent role file carries its own "Agent Briefing"
section (file rules, shell rules, quality bar). There is
no separate shared briefing skill; test-writer.md and
implementer.md keep their briefing blocks in sync
manually.
